== Requirements ==

- xMoney Merchant account
- Online store in Wordpress with WooCommerce plugin v3.0 (or greater)
- Products must be Purchases (payment method won't be displayed for Subscriptions)

== Setup ==

= On the xMoney side =

1. Go to the [xMoney Merchant dashboard](https://merchants.utrust.com).
2. [Log in](https://merchants.dev-utrust.com/sign-in), or [sign up](https://merchants.utrust.com/onboarding/sign-up) if you haven't yet.
3. In the sidebar on the left choose _Store_.
4. Click the button _Generate Credentials_.
5. You will now see your `Api Key` and `Webhook Secret`, save them somewhere safe temporarily.

   You will only be able to see the `Webhook Secret` once! After refreshing or changing page you will no longer be able to copy it. However, you can always regenerate your credentials as needed.

   WARNING: Don't share your credentials with anyone. They can use it to place and validate orders **on your behalf**.

= On the Wordpress side =

1. Go to your Wordpress admin dashboard.
2. Navigate to _WooCommerce > Settings_.
3. Choose the _Payments_ tab (or _Checkout_ in older versions).
4. Click on _xMoney_.
5. Add your `Api Key` and `Webhook Secret` and click _Save_.
6. (Optional) You can change the `Callback URL` if you are not using the default WooCommerce API.

= Known conflicts with other Plugins =

Some plugins that may create problems with the WooCommerce API:

- [Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) – xMoney plugin doesn't support yet automatic subscriptions, so the payment method won't be displayed when there is a Subscription on the cart.

- [WPML](https://wpml.org/) – If configurated to use URL parameters, it redirects the HTTP requests to the WooCommerce API to the site URL with the `lang=en` parameter. One of the solutions is to change WPML to a folder system (`/en/`), another is to add the default language parameter in the `Callback URL` setting (e.g. `https://<your-site>/?lang=en&wc-api=wc_utrust`).

= Does this support both live mode and test mode for testing? =

Yes, it does - choosing between live and test mode is driven by the API keys you use. They are different in both environments. Live API keys won't work for the test environment, and vice-versa.

= What happens if I cancel the Order manually? =

We are working on it. Our API is not ready yet for merchant manual changes. If you need to change the Order status, change it in WooCommerce and then go to our Merchant Dashboard to start a refund.
